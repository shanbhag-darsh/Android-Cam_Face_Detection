# Android-Cam_Face_Detection
In this project i have used a simple mobile camera to take live video feed and detect faces
Please make sure that you save HaarCascade XML files from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.
I have uploded the XML Files, but its better you opt to save it from the above mentioned link for both faces and eyes.
You will have to download IPWEBCAM app on your android phones and watch youtube videos about how to use it.


Have a Happy Project Time!!!
